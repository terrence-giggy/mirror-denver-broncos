goal: |
  Process approval and rejection commands in source proposal Discussions.
  
  Triggered by:
  1. Discussion comments containing `/approve-source`
  2. Discussion comments containing `/reject-source [reason]`
  
  Actions:
  1. For `/approve-source` commands:
     - Verify Discussion is in "Sources" category
     - Verify source is not already registered
     - Create Issue with `source-approved` label
     - Assign Issue to copilot for implementation
     - Post approval confirmation to Discussion with Issue link
  
  2. For `/reject-source` commands:
     - Post rejection summary with reason to Discussion
     - Mark Discussion as resolved/rejected
     - No Issue is created

constraints:
  - "Never register sources directly - create Issue for implementation"
  - "Require explicit `/approve-source` or `/reject-source` command"
  - "Only process commands in 'Sources' category Discussions"
  - "Maintain audit trail in Discussion thread"
  - "Derived sources require implementation_issue reference"

success_criteria:
  - Approved sources have implementation Issues created
  - Issues have `source-approved` label and are assigned to copilot
  - Rejected sources are documented with reasons in Discussion
  - All decisions are transparent in Discussion thread
