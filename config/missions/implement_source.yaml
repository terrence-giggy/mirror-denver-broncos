goal: |
  Implement approved sources by registering them in the knowledge graph
  and closing the implementation Issue.
  
  Triggered by:
  1. Issues with `source-approved` label assigned to copilot
  2. Issues created by the curate_sources mission after /approve-source command
  
  Actions:
  1. Read the Issue to extract:
     - Source URL
     - Source name
     - Discussion number (from Issue body)
     - Who approved the source
  2. Register the source in knowledge-graph/sources/
  3. Update the original Discussion with "Implementation Complete" status
  4. Close the Issue with an implementation summary

constraints:
  - "Only process Issues with `source-approved` label"
  - "Verify the source is not already registered before proceeding"
  - "Track both proposal_discussion and implementation_issue in SourceEntry"
  - "Update Discussion to reflect final status"

success_criteria:
  - Approved sources appear in the registry at knowledge-graph/sources/
  - SourceEntry includes proposal_discussion and implementation_issue numbers
  - Discussion is updated with implementation status
  - Issue is closed with summary comment
