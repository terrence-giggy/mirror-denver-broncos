goal: |
  Review the issue conversation to extract repository configuration details
  (Source URL, Topic, Frequency, Model).

  Actions Required:
  1. Fetch the full conversation history using `get_issue_comments` with the provided `issue_number`.
  2. Analyze the conversation for configuration details.
  3. If the Source URL is present, validate it using `validate_url`.
  4. If information is missing or the URL is invalid:
     - Post a comment asking the user to provide the missing details or correct the URL.
  5. If all information is present and valid:
     - Call `configure_upstream` to set the UPSTREAM_REPO repository variable (enables automatic code sync from template).
     - Attempt to create a welcome announcement using `create_welcome_announcement` with the topic (and source_url if available).
       - If successful, include the discussion URL in your response.
       - If it fails due to missing Announcements category, note this in your response (user can create it manually).
     - Post a comment instructing GitHub Copilot to:
       "Configure the repository with Source URL: [URL], Topic: [Topic], Frequency: [Freq], Model: [Model].
       1. Remove all files and subdirectories from `dev_data/` directory (but preserve the `dev_data/` directory itself).
       2. Create `config/manifest.json` with the following JSON structure:
          { \"source_url\": \"[URL]\", \"topic\": \"[Topic]\", \"frequency\": \"[Freq]\", \"model\": \"[Model]\" }
       3. Clean the `evidence/`, `knowledge-graph/`, and `reports/` directories (delete all files but keep `.gitkeep`)."
       4. Re-write README.md to reflect the research goals defined in the manifest. This is no longer a template repo.
     - Assign the issue to Copilot using `assign_issue_to_copilot`.

constraints:
  - Do NOT perform the setup actions (cleaning, configuring, committing) yourself. Delegate to Copilot.
  - Only assign to Copilot if the configuration is complete and valid.
  - If the user does not specify a model, default to "gpt-4o".

success_criteria:
  - Configuration details extracted and validated.
  - User requested for more info OR Copilot instructed and assigned.
  - Welcome announcement created (or noted if category missing).
