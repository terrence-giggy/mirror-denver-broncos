Intended to reflect the natural elements of Colorado, this uniform set is a collective tribute to Broncos Country. Emblazoned with unique aspects of Colorado's landscape, the uniforms infuse the heart of our fandom directly into its fabric.
The Details
The sleeve cap represents a mountain peak, created from the linework in the jaw of our primary Broncos logo, and highlights our rugged terrain. The brighter contrasted semicircle above represents the sun rising and setting behind the mountain peak; and the dawn of a new day.
Numberset takes designs cues from our current look, merged with a more classic block-style to create a modern font that's recognizable as the Broncos. Dissipating triangle perforation in front and back numbers nods to thinning air at the higher elevations.
Triangle perforations under the sleeve not only more boldly convey the thinning air at higher elevation, but are also a nod to Colorado summit markers, outdoor performance gear aesthetics and a connection to the legacy built from our three Super Bowl Championships in 1997, 1998 and 2015.
"Broncos Country" is woven into the inner neckline to serve as a rally cry to our players and represent the Broncos' passionate fanbase.
Font is simplified for a cleaner look, with rounded interior corners as a nod to routered edges on parks signage found across the Rocky Mountains.
Triangle back neck label is inspired by the iconography of summit markers found in Broncos Country and signifies striving to reach the peak. It is applied using webbing material, reminiscent of outdoor performance gear.
The pant stripe merges jagged mountain with a standard pant stripe visual, representing summiting a mountain peak. 5280 sits centered vertically on the stripe to signify our altitude advantage.
5280 inside of the neck represents Denver sitting at 5,280 feet above sea level.
A new primary navy metallic satin helmet.
A new alternate white metallic satin helmet.
The primary logo continues on each side of the crown with a stripe of triangle clusters rising from the base of the helmet to the middle of the crown, signifying Denver's peak in elevation.
