ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — The Broncos are donning a classic look for their critical regular-season finale.
Denver will wear its throwback jerseys for a Week 18 matchup with the Los Angeles Chargers at Empower Field at Mile High.
The Broncos previously wore the throwbacks in a Week 8 win over the Cowboys and a Week 10 win vs. the Raiders. Since the introduction of the Mile High Collection at the start of the 2024 season, Denver is 4-0 in the throwback uniforms.
Denver's throwback uniforms feature orange jerseys with oversized white numbers and Legacy Blue trim. The team's white pants include an orange-and-Legacy-Blue strip, and the Broncos will wear orange-and-blue striped socks, as well. The helmet features the iconic Denver "D" logo on a Legacy Blue shell, a white facemask and a vertical orange stripe.
The matchup with the Chargers will mark the Broncos' fourth and final game this season wearing alternate jerseys. In addition to its three games with the throwback look, the Broncos wore their Midnight Navy jerseys in Week 4 against the Bengals.
The Broncos host the Chargers on Sunday, Jan. 4 at 2:25 p.m. MT on CBS with the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC.
