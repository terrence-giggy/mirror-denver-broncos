The Broncos will host the Los Angeles Chargers in the 2025 regular-season finale on Sunday, Jan. 4 at 2:25 p.m. MT on CBS.
MATCHUP
The Broncos will look to clinch home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs as they fight for a win against the Chargers in Week 18. With a victory, Denver would secure the top seed in the AFC and also lock up a first-round bye.
Denver will aim to earn its best regular-season record since 1998 and its best home and division marks since 2014 as the team looks to even the season series with Los Angeles.

The Broncos released their second injury report of the week on Thursday. Click here for more details.
