ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — A pair of Broncos returned to practice Wednesday ahead of the team's regular-season finale.
Tight end Nate Adkins (knee) and wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) were both limited participants in Wednesday's practice after being held out of Denver's Week 17 win. Both players suffered their injuries in Week 16.
Inside linebacker Karene Reid (hamstring), who was designated for return ahead of Week 16, remained a full participant in practice. Reid has not yet been activated to the Broncos' 53-man roster.
Guard Ben Powers (biceps) also remained a full participant after playing 41 snaps in Denver's win over the Chiefs.
Defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers (hip) was listed as a limited participant for the Broncos, while linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) was the lone player who did not practice.
Denver will announce an additional set of practice statuses on Thursday before sharing its Week 18 game statuses on Friday.
The Broncos face the Chargers with a chance to clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC on Sunday, Jan. 4 at 2:25 p.m. MT
